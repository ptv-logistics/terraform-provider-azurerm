# azurerm_app_service_certificate

Manages an App Service certificate.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_app_service_certificate" "example" {
  name                = "example-cert"
  resource_group_name = "${azurerm_resource_group.example.name}"
  location            = "${azurerm_resource_group.example.location}"
  pfx_blob            = "${filebase64("certificate.pfx")}"
  password            = "terraform"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the certificate. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which to create the certificate. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) Specifies the supported Azure location where the resource exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `pfx_blob` - (Optional) The base64-encoded contents of the certificate. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

-> **NOTE:** Either `pfx_blob` or `key_vault_secret_id` must be set - but not both.

* `password` - (Optional) The password to access the certificate's private key. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `key_vault_secret_id` - (Optional) The ID of the Key Vault secret. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

-> **NOTE:** If using `key_vault_secret_id`, the magic Resource Principal with id of `abfa0a7c-a6b6-4736-8310-5855508787cd` must have 'Secret -> get' and 'Certificate -> get' permissions on the Key Vault containing the certificate.
